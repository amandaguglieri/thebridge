Here I will collect some of the exercises we're practising at The bridge

## Piedra, papel o tijera

Basic logic for the game. Implemented for terminal (not environment). What is interesting in my implementation is the use of module operation, reducing the number of conditionals and making the game scalable.

## ticketing

Basic logic for the implementation of a ticketing service. We were asked to use dictionaries (ticketing_group.py). I though it was more challenging to use classes (ticketing_amanda.py).

## client-server experiment: sockets!
Small program in which a client asks a server to capitalize a string. It's intended to check out how sockets work.
