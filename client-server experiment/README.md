# Sockets!

Basic communication between a client and a server machine with a TCP connection. You can replicate it by using two VMs: one as a client and the other as a server.

## Instruccions
1. Run TCPServer in the machine that performs as a server: 
2. Change line 2 of TCPClient.py and enter your server ip:
  serverName = "servername or ip"
3. Run TCPClient.py in the machine intended to be the client.

## What is for
The program that runs in the server capitalizes the string entered in the client side.

## Wireshark
sockets_TPC.pcapng file captures traffic of a test.
